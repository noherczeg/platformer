> Work In Progress!

A pet project for testing native browser capabilities for simple features
generally used by everyday apps.

Without any dependencies or build steps.

## Start

The app should run in server context, but in local development mode it's
required to fire up a static server with mock data.

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Agenda

- [x] No build steps
- [ ] Hash routing
- [ ] Basic authentication and authorization
- [ ] Semantic HTMl elements where possible
- [ ] Layouts with slots

## Known limitations

- Lazy module imports are not supported by native APIs
- Minification not available by default
- Cache busting not available by default
